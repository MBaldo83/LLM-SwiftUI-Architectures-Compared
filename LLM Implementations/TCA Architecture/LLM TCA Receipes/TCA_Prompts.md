I want to build an app that has a list of recipes, and each recipe in the list can be seleected to display the recipe details. Using The Composable Architecture (TCA) architecture described here @https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture, navigation described here @https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/navigation and sharing state described here @https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/sharingstate please describe the main structs and classes I need to build to create these 2 views
---
Can you change RecipeListView to use the latest TCA syntax where store is Bindable, and we no longer need WithViewStore
---
Please update RecipeListFeature to use the latest TCA syntax making use of the Reducer macro 
---
update RecipeListView to use a NavigationStack as described in Stack Based Navigation here: @https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/stackbasednavigation 
---
(debugging)
Initializer 'init(path:root:destination:fileID:filePath:line:column:)' requires that 'RecipeDetailFeature.State' conform to 'ObservableState'
---
(debugging)
Missing argument for parameter 'store' in call
---
update Recipe to have an array of related recipes linked using the recipe id
---
(debugging)
Value of type 'Recipe' has no member 'with'
---
update recipe to have a property thumbSelection that is an optional enum ThumbSelection with cases thumbsUp and thumbsDown
---
update RecipeListView to use a MultiThumbSelectionView allowing the user to give a recipe a thumbs up or a thumbs down
