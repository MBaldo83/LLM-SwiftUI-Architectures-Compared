I want to build an app that has a list of recipes, and each recipe in the list can be seleected to display the recipe details. Using the Model View (MV) architecture described here @https://azamsharp.medium.com/building-large-scale-apps-with-swiftui-a-guide-to-modular-architecture-9c967be13001 please describe the main structs and classes I need to build to create these 2 views
---
I want to be able to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to each recipe, add an enum with these 2 options, which should be an optional variable on the recipe model
---
nest rating inside recipe model
---
(copied the shared view code into the project)
(cursor in the navigation link row)
Allow the give a rating to the recipe in the list view
---
copied method invocation: "recipeModel.updateRating(for: recipe.id, rating: newRating)"
"update the RecipeModel class to implement this method"
---
Implement the fetch recipes function to return a hard coded list of recipes with 4 names, apple pie, baklava, bolo rolo and chocolate crackles
---
I want to be able to associate receipes with related recipes using the receipe id
---
(copied error from XCode)
Value of optional type '[UUID]?' must be unwrapped to refer to member 'contains' of wrapped base type '[UUID]'
